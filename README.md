# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Implementation
In this project, I have implemented a list of star wars films in the grid format using the below information
(1) Star wars logo
(2) Film title
(3) Episode number
(4) Read more link

(The above screen implementation is done in the dashboard.js component)

Upon clicking anywhere on the card, the user will be redirected to details page to see the below information
(1) Star wars logo
(2) Film title
(3) Episode number
(4) Release date
(5) Added date
(6) Director(s)
(7) Producer(s)
(8) Cast
(9) Film Description

(The above screen implementation is done in the filmDetails.js component)

On clicking the Films link in the breadcrumb on top left corner, the user will be redirected to the list of star wars films screen

Upon entering the wrong URL, it will take the user to the Page not Found screen and clicking on the logo will take the user to the list of star wars films screen
